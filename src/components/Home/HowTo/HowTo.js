                                    Creating a survey using the Survey WZRDs tool is simple. All you need to do is click on the ‘CREATE SURVEY’ button in the navigation bar and fill out the form.
                                    <br/>
                                    The title should be a short precise description of the surveys topic.
                                    <br/>
                                    Enter your companies name in the top right corner to show it in the embedded survey.
                                    <br/>
                                    In the grey box underneath the title you can enter a more detailed description. Here you can tell your survey participants more information about the survey.
                                    <br/>
                                    Now to the most important part: Enter your survey question in the question field.
                                    <br/>
                                    Below the question you can enter the possible answer options (max. 45 words per answer). You must provide a minimum of 2 and maximum of 8 answer options. To add more answers, just click on the "+". Vice versa, to remove answers, click on the "-".
                                    <br/>
                                    Per default, the survey participants can choose only one out of all provided answers. If you want to allow several answers, click on the toggle so that it gets blue.
                                    <br/>
                                    Using a date picker, you can choose an expiry date for your survey. After this date, the survey will be disabled.
                                    <br/>
                                    And lastly, all you need to do is hit the ‘create’ button and you have successfully created a new survey!
